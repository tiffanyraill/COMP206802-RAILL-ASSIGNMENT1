Portfolio Assignment PART 2
I have added on to my portfolio assignment to complete Assignment 2. Because this is an app I would like to be able to keep,
the login functionality just encompasses the CRUD functionality of the "Papers" page. Please feel free to add a document 
or delete one to view the modal that pops up upon deletion. Also added scroll function to table.
 
 As my additional feature  I have implemented fully functional emailing, feel free to log in to the email address to test.
 credentials are shown in server.js and will be changed end of semester.
